Anyone who knows me knows that I come from the middle east. 
So I will often go there to visit my family and friends. 
This has been going on since a young age, it can get really boring in the middle east so my parents would consistently put me in these camps where I would play soccer and stuff.
This came into play at my birthday party when I was 3 and everybody started singing Happy Birthday. 
During this time, I was sitting down while my mom was crouching next to me. 
Once everyone started clapping, I let out a loud shriek and fell onto my mom who in turn fell to the floor. 
What makes it worse was that my mom was also 6 months pregnant with my little brother... and the fact that it's all on video and they show it to literally all of my friends that come over. They also played it during my Bar Mitzvah montage. Thanks Mom.
My Dad thought it was hilarious and reminded me every time we passed by it. 
I'll preface this by saying my mom was a very angry and emotional driver.
Apparently when I was 3 or 4 I was at a neighbor's house looking at her Christmas cards and some of them had Jesus on the cover. My neighbor pointed to him and said to me, 'That's Jesus Christ. Do you know who that is?'
And I said, 'Sure. That's the guy mommy always talks to in the car.'
My dad loves to tell any dates that I bring home about the time I pooped in a public pool.
My dad has started telling the story about the time he took me to his friends wedding when I was three.
I was a very observant, loud and blunt child. My dads other favorite stories are all the times he would take me out in public when I was a baby and I would burp or fart and no one believed it came from me.
When I was young, probably 7 or 8. My family and much of my extended family were at a buffet, my sister was about 12-13. She got up to get more food and when this happened I noticed she dropped her napkin on the floor. I then promptly picked it up and quite loudly stated that my sister dropped her rag. 
I was very young and recently learned how to use the big boy toilet, but my family had distilled the 'ask before doing' mentality into me. So one day I have the urge, but my parents are in the garden and from the living room they didn't hear my plea to go upstairs...things got a little heated and my quick thinking decision was to empty my toy box and pee in there as I didn't have permission to go upstairs. Smart right? Only beaten by my brothers decision to get out of the shower because he needed a pee, and then proceeded to go in our wooden/wicker bin next to the shower. 
My family and family friends all joke about the time I got my tongue stuck to a frozen fence post.
All of my siblings are at least 10 years older than me
I was four years old and my family was at the Grand Canyon.
Apparently it went to this woman whose husband owned a home business but he was out of town. She thought I was a creep and called the police. They traced the calls back to my mum and she blamed my older sisters for it. 
I went to school with the womans daughter when I was older.
When my dad and i were going camping in canada, the boarder gaurd asked if i knew this man
My dad will NEVER let me live that down.
My mom told me my fish went on vacation
Around Halloween or so, my mom mentioned that dad had radiation burns on his neck. Dad was a radiation oncologist, but I was confused as to why he'd be so close to get burned. 
i found a wedding photograph of him with his first wife and asked him
My brother's wife had been married for 4 months previously
It makes me wonder if their children know. 
my father had married before he married my mother.
My mum got married before my dad. I only found out by chance when I saw a family tree and saw the previous marriage. I asked about it and my mum didn't say much about it. I don't want to ask again. But it was a large segment in my mum's life that I know nothing about. I don't even know if they had children.
That my father used to be married to my aunt.
My mom lives with the ex-husband of my dad's wife. My mom's boyfriend and my dad's wife have 3 kids.
My dad met my mom in a strip club.
My brother and I have crazy funneled to us from every angle. 
That my fathers parents had 7 children
My mother is exactly the same, so I can relate.
When I was 12 my mom gave birth to my half-sister, and she couldn't come home with us. We had to visit her at a foster care building, where my mom would feed her, play with her, and then sit in the car and cry for 20 minutes. 
I have an older half-brother who was given up for adoption.
My grandpa was taken into the RAF after he stole a loaf of bread. He was only 16, so legally, he shouldn't have been allowed to, but he lied about his age. He figured he could make money to send back to his 10 other brothers and sisters since his mom was crushed under a filing cabinet and his dad was an abusive drunk.
He met my grandmother on his first leave at some weird German bar
When I was a teenager I found pictures of my mom in an army uniform. Never knew she enlisted, and if you knew her you would be shocked. I asked her about it and she told me.she just did boot camp and it wasn't for her, but she enlisted for college money ( there are 9 kids in her family). I dropped it. A few years later, Mt older sister told me a little more. One night while out to dinner with my dad she was saying how she doesn't like one of the aunts. 
Mom and Dad stayed together to raise my sister and I. Now, close with both and Mom and Dad are still best friends. Super confusing at first but now it's just the way it happened. My mom was confused as well, after having my sis and I she vowed to raise us with my dad in the pic
my mother's father had a whole secret second family and when she was little.
My parents divorced when I was 6 
my oldest sister was only my stepsister.
While Dad was away, the grandmother (a widow of ten years) had found a man in the previous year, and finally got married. This is my grandmother. Now, the grooms brother came for the wedding and stayed to look for work in the area, and had been welcomed to remain with Mom and her two younger brothers while my grandmother went on a honeymoon.
in the late 70's, my Uncle was studying medicine at the University of Chicago. 
My great-grandfather on my dad's side was making moonshine on his farm in Canada. My great-grandmother turned him in to the authorities and he went to jail for who knows how long.
My father-in-law is working himself into the ground for his family even though it is fairly plain they are just using him.
SO and I also have a toddler daughter.
My brother and I have always had a tough relationship.
I just want to be closer to my family because they're with me the rest of my life. I want to connect with my brother so that he is like an actual brother to me and not some stranger who lives in the same house as me.
I haven't found a real solution to repairing my solution with my sister but since my parents separated she has gotten a lot better as far as not acting like a kindergartener. Me and my sister have some small talk going on and I will always make a point to tell her I am proud of her for whatever recent accomplishment she's done. I always try to offer to take her out places when I have the money.
 I have a 6 month old boy and a 9 yr old girl my little girl is currently staying with my mom until we get a place of our own cuz I don't want to move her from school to school to school I live with my boyfriends parents they take over everything give my son food coffee and don't tell me we don't have enough to move out for a while on 1 income any suggestions please you don't understand it is VERY hard and stressing
My niece who just recently turned 12 is growing up to be a bit of a brat. I come from an upper middle class family, my sister is a lawyer and married a lawyer, they make good income. However, their 12-year-old daughter who is also my god-daughter is growing up to be the type of person I would not like to befriend in high school, college, or life. My parents are very humble people, and they taught me well, I believe that's why I grew up to be the way I am, I don't value money, I don't judge people based on it, and I don't care for looks as much as society does. I don't know how to inspire my niece to be this way. There's not much of an age difference between us, I'm 21 and a senior in college right now. I go home often so I see her a lot, I'm always trying to hang out with her and get her interested in something, I don't even care what as long as she is passionate about it. I tried to get her into science since that's what I like, but it didn't work out. Then I tried sports, tennis, soccer, golf, anything I ever did, even ballet which I always hated, she doesn't like any of it. In fact, she's already in pep-squad or whatever you call pre-cheerleaders. And yes, I was a cheerleader hater in high school. One of my good friends was a cheerleader, and surprised me by being everything I didn't expect her to be. So I guess there's yet hope for my niece, even if she goes down that path. I don't really care what she does, it's her attitude that worries me. Her priorities in life are having the best of everything, having the prettiest friends, and being popular. She seems selfish enough to step on others to get her way. I don't want to dislike my own niece, especially since I love her so much.
My mom, who is much like myself, seems to have noticed the same things I did, and suggested we take her to do some volunteer work. Do you guys think that is a good idea? Would it even help?
My only set back are overly religious parents who I am afraid to introduce him to. I want them to like him and him to like them but I'm so frustrated because my parents can never stop talking about religious stuff. I'm used to it cause I'm their kid but it's impossible to explain to someone who didn't grow up with it how on earth they aren't fanatical religious crazy people. 
It's a struggle to get parents to see their adult children as adults. I have experienced that a lot with my own parents and my in laws. I understand somewhat. I have a daughter (soon to be two) and I know that while I always want her to be happy some of her choices could be hard to accept (she's 15 months right now, so I have a long time before I have to worry about it). 
I come from a big family, not the best, or the worst. I come from any ordinary family. We have ups and downs, laughter, and tears. I've been in so many situations, that some people haven't experience. I'm not bragging about my family. I am just saying no matter what happens, the shit you go through, you will learn to appreciate and love your family more.
I grew up in a home with only brothers, I have a mom, and a dad of course, my older brothers are half blood, but I don't like to think that way. Growing up my childhood wasn't the brightest or beautiful-est. I was abused, mistreated, and all the asian things you can think of. Of course my parents loved me, but that was what I remembered. I never really had a official Birthday Party until I was 11. We always had just Within the family birthdays.
My grandmother's birthday is October 28th. In 2011, she chose to spend her birthday at my mom's house. I, for whatever reason, thought her birthday was on the 29th that year. I was going to travel to my mom's on the 29th, a Saturday, to celebrate it with her. 
My parents have never been divorced and I have three brothers. One older, and two younger. I've always felt excluded from the rest because I have always been very independent. I wasn't the easiest child to raise. I always formed my own idea's and opinions and have always done what I felt was best for me in my life. I constantly disagreed with my parents as a teenager and know I was unnecessarily belligerent at times. Looking back I wonder if my parents for some reason took it personally and didn't recognize it as me being hormonal and rebellious. I've always had a very strong personality and I never really fell in line with what my parents wanted like my brothers always have. I never thought to much of it despite what I perceived as favoritism growing up because I assumed my parents always loved me just as much.
I moved out of the house about six months after graduating high school. I honestly sat around for those six months without a care in the world. My parents didn't seem to mind to much for the first few months until they started pressuring me to do something with my life. I had always intended to figure something out but wanted to take that time to decided what I wanted. I knew at the time I wanted to marry my girlfriend of three years and had to decide how to make that happen. My mom has never fully supported the relationship and to this day her and I still have no idea why.
I ended up joining the Army. My older brother was in the reserves at the time and I felt it would challenge me in ways I hadn't been challenged before. Especially with how physically inactive I was growing up. I never found school particularly challenging and had mulled the idea of college over before ultimately deciding I might not have the discipline or want to maintain good grades and actually graduate college and put those student loans to good use. My parents also were not very supportive of me leaving town and my mom constantly pushed me towards a local community college. My mom was very upset about this decision and constantly tried to change my mind. My dad and brother, however, were very supportive.
After my older brother broke up with his girlfriend, my mom was devastated. He ended up moving back home and has been there for the past two years. I visited my parents in Washington for my sons first birthday, which feel on Thanksgiving. I remember my mom left the party for an hour to call my older brother's ex-girlfriend. I don't know what the call was for but it's never stopped hurting my feelings. I've now grown used to the emotional pain things like this cause me but it destroys me that my sons might not think their grandparents love them as much because they are my children as they might my brothers and their children.
Fast forward another year, and we are visiting my parents for Christmas. (We usually visit them once a year but my parents did visit us in Colorado after I had a series of seizures and they discovered I had developed epilepsy. I did really appreciate that and I tried really hard to let them know.) I was surprised to find my brothers had completely lost any life ambitions they had once had. My older brother and his now pregnant girlfriend live in my parents basement and my parents plan to build them a house in their backyard. My younger brother has quit college and lives at home. My older brother visited my family once while we were there despite living in the basement. 
Since coming home I've tried harder to each out to my parents and call my mom at least once a week. I still haven't talked to any of my brothers. My older brother found out his girlfriend was pregnant recently and I tried calling him. He didn't answer so I left a message but he never got back to me. When my parents told me, it was because I had asked about the wedding I was told they were having in October and my mom told me it had to be pushed back. I guess they had known for a little bit, but my mom said they were only telling family first. I know it wasn't intentional, but that hurt my feelings more than I could ever express through words. No one in my family had even bothered to call and let me know.
On a trip to New York, my 11-year-old son and I were headed downtown on the subway. We were late, and without my wife, the family subway Sherpa. (I do airports and we both have specialized knowledge about train travel.) No problem. I figured out the route, the transfer spot, and, since I handle insouciance in our family, no one could accuse me of being a tourist, though it had been 15 years since I’d lived there.
The kids are doing more than just picking up the physical load. They’re sharing the mental load too. My daughter is obsessed with camp (we've talked about this before, you may remember), so she researched the camps, the flights she’d take, and the dates that worked with her school schedule. That spared us time waiting for Expedia to load, which was nice, but it also freed us from some of the worry that we’d pick the right place for her.
When we take family walks in the woods, the kids love to show us where they cross the creek, or the paths they’ve cut through. That’s what these little bits of mastery are: routes they have carved out of the world that are their own. Stuff that hasn’t come from their parents.
Once we started to rely on the kids, it became a habit
I live in a large family. There are eight members in it. They are my father, my mother, my grand-father, my grand-mother, myself, my brother and my two sisters.
The peace and progress of a family depend upon its members. If the members are good, the family gets prestige. Our family is a joint family. My father has two more brothers. He is the eldest. Both of his brothers are service holders. They are married. But they do not live in our village. One of them lives in Uttar Pradesh whiles the other in Calcutta with their respective family members. Thus my father stays in the native village and looks after the entire paternal property. Though theoretically a joint family, practically my father alone lives with us in our village. My grandmother is alive.
My father is a farmer. He is also an educated person. He was a village school master. But he gave up that job and adopted farming. He is respected by all. Our both the uncles send money every month to my father. We are five members such as father, mother, grandmother, me and my sister. I am the youngest member of our family. I am loved by all. My mother is a pious woman. She does all the domestic works in our family. As my grandmother is old, she is properly nursed by my parents. I am the most favorite of my grandmother.
My sister, who is two years senior to me, is a post graduate. After her post graduation, she is looking for a job. She is at present working as a teacher in the local high school. If she is selected, she may permanently work there. She is a good teacher. She is appreciated by all. My mother is worried about my sister's marriage. But my father says that she will marry only after getting a permanent job. My sister also wants a regular job first.
I am reading in City College. I shall complete my graduation this year. I want to prepare for the civil service. My uncles, who are Central Government Officers, are inspiring me for this administrative line.
Our family is a happy family. My father is respected by all in our village as an ideal and truthful person. In case of any dispute in our village, my father is invited to solve it.
Family is an important unit of society. It holds great importance in social life. It is the strongest unit of society. A society is made up of families.
A family is the first school in which a child receives the basic values of life. He learns good manners in the family. The morals and values learnt in family become our guiding force. They make our character. They lay the foundation of our thinking. I feel fortunate to be born in a family where values are inculcated in early childhood.
I belong to a middle class family. There are six members in my family. They are our parents, grandparents, I and my younger sister. Our grandfather is the head of the family. He enjoys a commanding position. His decision is final in family matters. Nobody can dare to go against him. Everybody respects him. He is the guardian of the family. He is a cool and considerate man. He is just and fair. His decision is never influenced by any other. He is a retired teacher. He helps us in our study. Our grandmother makes us hear good stories.
My father is a police officer. He is a great disciplinarian. He is sincere and hardworking. He always goes to office in time. My mother is a simple housewife. She is a postgraduate in English. She is soft-natured and caring. She takes great care of us. She does not care for her comfort for us. She looks after our grandparents. She helps the poor and the needy. She is religious and God-fearing.
Our family has been known for discipline and values. We give great importance to values and morals in life. Since our early childhood we are taught to respect the elders and love the children. We learnt the lesson of punctuality and honesty from our grandfather. It is due to the good education of our grandparents that we could excel both in sports and education. Since our childhood we have been put into the habit of rising early in the morning. This has a natural effect on our health and physical fitness.
Our family is like a heaven. There is peace, prosperity, love and care. The younger’s have regard and respect for the elders while the elders shower them with their love and affection. The instructions of the elders are followed with great respect. If a member has some problem the whole family is beside him. I am proud of my family.
My wife and I had 12 children over the course of 15 1/2 years. Today, our oldest is 37 and our youngest is 22.  I have always had a very prosperous job and enough money to give my kids almost anything. But my wife and I decided not to.
I will share with you the things that we did, but first let me tell you the results: All 12 of my children have college degrees (or are in school), and we as parents did not pay for it. Most have graduate degrees. Those who are married have wonderful spouses with the same ethics and college degrees, too. We have 18 grandchildren who are learning the same things that our kids learned—self respect, gratitude, and a desire to give back to society.
We raised our family in Utah, Florida, and California; my wife and I now live in Colorado. In March, we will have been married 40 years. I attribute the love between us as a part of our success with the children. They see a stable home life with a commitment that does not have compromises.
Here’s what we did right (we got plenty wrong, too, but that’s another list):
Kids had to perform chores from age 3. A 3-year-old does not clean toilets very well but by the time he is 4, it’s a reasonably good job.
They got allowances based on how they did the chores for the week.
We had the children wash their own clothes by the time they turned 8. We assigned them a wash day.
When they started reading, they had to make dinner by reading a recipe. They also had to learn to double a recipe.
The boys and girls had to learn to sew.
    We had study time from 6 to 8pm every week day. No television, computer, games, or other activities until the two hours were up. If they had no homework, then they read books. For those too young to be in school, we had someone read books to them. After the two hours, they could do whatever they wanted as long as they were in by curfew.
    All the kids were required to take every Advanced Placement class there was. We did not let entrance scores be an impediment. We went to the school and demanded our kids be let in. Then we, as parents, spent the time to ensure they had the understanding to pass the class. After the first child, the school learned that we kept our promise that the kids could handle the AP classes.
    If children would come home and say that a teacher hated them or was not fair, our response was that you need to find a way to get along. You need find a way to learn the material because in real life, you may have a boss that does not like you. We would not enable children to “blame” the teacher for not learning, but place the responsibility for learning the material back on the child. Of course, we were alongside them for two hours of study a day, for them to ask for help anytime.
    We all ate dinner and breakfast together. Breakfast was at 5:15am and then the children had to do chores before school. Dinner was at 5:30pm.
    More broadly, food was interesting. We wanted a balanced diet, but hated it when we were young and parents made us eat all our food. Sometimes we were full and just did not want to eat anymore. Our rule was to give the kids the food they hated most first (usually vegetables) and then they got the next type of food. They did not have to eat it and could leave the table. If later they complained they were hungry, we would get out that food they did not want to eat, warm it up in the microwave, and provide it to them. Again, they did not have to eat it. But they got no other food until the next meal unless they ate it.
    We did not have snacks between meals. We always had the four food groups (meat, dairy, grain, fruits and vegetables) and nearly always had dessert of some kind. To this day, our kids are not afraid to try different foods, and have no allergies to foods. They try all kinds of new foods and eat only until they are full. Not one of our kids is even a little bit heavy. They are thin, athletic, and very healthy. With 12 kids, you would think that at least one would have some food allergies or food special needs. (I am not a doctor.)
    All kids had to play some kind of sport. They got to choose, but choosing none was not an option. We started them in grade school. We did not care if it was swimming, football, baseball, fencing, tennis, etc. and did not care if they chose to change sports. But they had to play something.
    All kids had to be in some kind of club: Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, history, drama, etc.
    They were required to provide community service. We would volunteer within our community and at church. For Eagle Scout projects, we would have the entire family help. Once we collected old clothes and took them to Mexico and passed them out. The kids saw what life was like for many families and how their collections made them so happy and made a difference.
    When the kids turned 16, we bought each a car. The first one learned what that meant. As the tow truck pulled a once “new” car into the driveway, my oldest proclaimed: “Dad, it is a wreck!” I said, “Yes, but a 1965 Mustang fastback wreck. Here are the repair manuals. Tools are in the garage. I will pay for every part, but will not pay for LABOR.” Eleven months later, the car had a rebuilt engine, rebuilt transmission, newly upholstered interior, a new suspension system, and a new coat of paint. My daughter (yes, it was my daughter) had one of the hottest cars at high school. And her pride that she built it was beyond imaginable. (As a side note, none of my kids ever got a ticket for speeding, even though no car had less than 450 horsepower.)
    We as parents allowed kids to make mistakes. Five years before the 16th birthday and their “new” car gift, they had to help out with our family cars. Once I asked my son, Samuel, to change the oil and asked if he needed help or instruction. “No, Dad, I can do it.” An hour later, he came in and said, “Dad, does it take 18 quarts of oil to change the oil?”  I asked where did he put 18 quarts of oil when normally only five were needed. His response: “That big screw on top at the front of the engine.”  I said “You mean the radiator?” Well, he did not get into trouble for filling the radiator with oil. He had to drain it, we bought a radiator flush, put in new radiator fluid, and then he had to change the real oil. We did not ground him or give him any punishment for doing it “wrong.” We let the lesson be the teaching tool. Our children are not afraid to try something new.  They were trained that if they do something wrong they will not get punished. It often cost us more money, but we were raising kids, not saving money.
    The kids each got their own computer, but had to build it. I bought the processor, memory, power supply, case, keyboard, hard drive, motherboard, and mouse. They had to put it together and load the software on. This started when they were 12.
    We let the children make their own choices, but limited. For example, do you want to go to bed now or clean your room? Rarely, did we give directives that were one way, unless it dealt with living the agreed-upon family rules. This let the child feel that she had some control over life.
In it together
    We required the children to help each other. When a fifth grader is required to read 30 minutes a day, and a first grader is required to be read to 30 minutes a day, have one sit next to the other and read. Those in high school calculus tutored those in algebra or grade-school math.
    We assigned an older child to a younger child to teach them and help them accomplish their weekly chores.
    We let the children be a part of making the family rules. For example, the kids wanted the rule that no toys were allowed in the family room. The toys had to stay either in the bedroom or playroom. In addition to their chores, they had to all clean their bedroom every day (or just keep it clean in the first place). These were rules that the children wanted. We gave them a chance each month to amend or create new rules. Mom and Dad had veto power of course.
    We tried to be always consistent. If they had to study two hours every night, we did not make an exception to it. Curfew was 10pm during school nights and midnight on non-school nights. There were no exceptions to the rules.
Vacation policy
    We would take family vacations every summer for two or three weeks. We could afford a hotel, or cruise, but did not choose those options. We went camping and backpacking. If it rained, then we would figure out how to backpack in the rain and survive. We would set up a base camp at a site with five or six tents, and I would take all kids age 6 or older on a three- to five-day backpack trip. My wife would stay with the little ones. Remember, for 15 years, she was either pregnant or just had a baby. My kids and I hiked across the Grand Canyon, to the top of Mount Whitney, across the Continental Divide, across Yosemite.
    We would send kids via airplane to relatives in Europe or across the US for two or three weeks at a time. We started this when they were in kindergarten. It would take special treatment for the airlines to take a 5-year-old alone on the plane and required people on the other end to have special documentation. We only sent the kids if they wanted to go. However, with the younger ones seeing the older ones travel, they wanted to go. The kids learned from an early age that we, as parents, were always there for them, but would let them grow their own wings and fly.
Money and materialism
    Even though we have sufficient money, we have not helped the children buy homes, pay for education, pay for weddings (yes, we do not pay for weddings either). We have provided extensive information on how to do it or how to buy rental units and use equity to grow wealth. We do not “give” things to our children but we give them information and teach them “how” to do things. We have helped them with contacts in corporations, but they have to do the interviews and “earn” the jobs.
    We give birthday and Christmas presents to the kids. We would play Santa Claus but as they got older, and would ask about it, we would not lie.  We would say it is a game we play and it is fun. We did and do have lists for items that each child would like for presents. Then everyone can see what they want. With the internet, it is easy to send such lists around to the children and grandchildren. Still, homemade gifts are often the favorite of all.
The real world
    We loved the children regardless of what they did. But would not prevent consequences of any of their actions. We let them suffer consequences and would not try to mitigate the consequences because we saw them suffering. We would cry and be sad, but would not do anything to reduce the consequences of their actions.
We were and are not our kids’ best friends.  We were their parents.
